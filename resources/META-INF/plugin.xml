  <name>Commit Log</name>
  <description><![CDATA[Creates a commit log for each commit executed, according to a user defined template.<br><br>
  This is mainly aimed at those of us who have a non-vcs integrated issue tracking system (e.g. bugzilla) and who want to record exact details of associated commits within their issue updates.<br>
  However, at present the plugin generates a simple textual log, based on a user-defined template, so this can be used for any purpose required, such as emailing or placing into documents.<br>
  Ultimately it is intended to implement automated actions to be performed post commit, e.g. for integration with issue trackers, or emailing of logs.<br>
  <br>
  Commit comments can also be generated based on files in the changelist to ease per-file commenting in the comment.
  <br>
  Settings can be edited on a per-project basis in Project Settings|Commit Log.<br>
  <br>
  To Do:<br>
  * Allow automated actions to be defined for execution using the generated commit log.<br>
  * Improve template editing.<br>
  * Add configuration of text used for change types.<br>
